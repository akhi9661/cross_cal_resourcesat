## Introduction

This code module applies a simple cross calibration on LISS III and AWiFS to calibrate them with the help
of a reference image like Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2.

Takes two inputs:
- `inpf_liss` = path to folder LISS III or AWiFS bands
- `inpf_ref` = path to folder containing reference image bands

Final output folder: 
- `inpf_liss\Reflectance\Calibration`

Four temporary images are also generated which are automatically deleted after the execution. These are two composite images,
one resampled image, and one clipped image
Note: Please make sure that both input and reference image have the same projection system. If not, please reproject the input.
